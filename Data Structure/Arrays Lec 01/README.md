## Dynamic Arrays <a name="Darrays"></a>

The aim of lecture one is to inroduce the definitions of performance margins like time analysis and memory analysis to know which function will bad with time or memory if the input was a large set of data.

Till now I dealt with the `BigO(n)` which describes the limiting behavior of a function when the the input grows.

I need to design a Dynamic array in c++ with certain specifications and define the BigO notation of every function I implement.

# The well-know curves: 

1. The Constant `O(1)`: if you access certain array index.
2. The Logarithmic `O(log(n))`: if we doing a binary search in the array.
3. The Linear `O(n)`: delete by shifting or doing linear search.
4. The Quadrture `O(n^2)`: any function two nested loops dealing with every element in array.
5. The Exponential `O(a^n)`: function with recursive calculation `Fibonacci` and `Factorial`.


## Functions and its Description<a name="Fdesc"></a>

will do the documentation very soon.
