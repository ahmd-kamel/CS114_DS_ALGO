## Linked Lists <a name="Llists"></a>
A linked list is a linear data structure (collection of data elements). it's very simmilar to the arrays, but unlike arrays it is consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. each node contains: data, and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence.
